## 🚀 MERN Stack Learning Journey

A comprehensive collection of projects and exercises built while mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with a focus on real-world, scalable application development.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey learning full-stack web development using the MERN stack. Each project is designed to implement industry best practices, scalable architecture patterns, and modern development workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js - JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- MongoDB - NoSQL database for flexible, scalable data storage
- Express.js - Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- React - Component-based UI library for building interactive interfaces

# React Job Listing Application

A modern job listing application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Browse, add, edit, and delete job postings with a clean and responsive interface.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS 4
- React Router DOM
- JSON Server (Mock API)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start the JSON Server (Backend):**

```bash
npm run server
```

Runs on `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Start the Development Server (Frontend):**
   Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run server` - Start JSON Server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

---

**Note:** Both servers (JSON Server and Vite dev server) need to run simultaneously for the app to work properly.
